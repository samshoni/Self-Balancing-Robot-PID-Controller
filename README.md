# Arduino MPU6050 Tilt LED

This project uses the MPU6050 Gyroscope + Accelerometer with Arduino to detect tilt and control an LED.

## Components
- Arduino Mega
- MPU6050 Sensor
- LED + Resistor (150Ω or 2.2kΩ)
- Jumper Wires

## Working
- When the sensor tilts forward → LED turns ON  
- When level or other tilt → LED turns OFF  

## Future Scope
- Extend to buzzer/servo indicator
- ROS2 integration for robotics
- Balancing robot foundation
